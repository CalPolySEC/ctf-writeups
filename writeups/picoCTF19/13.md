# Writeup

The challenge provides us with the flag but it appears to be ROT13 encoded. I used [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) for this challenge as it useful in many crypto challenges. First, input the provided encoded flag in the input section. Then search for ROT13 and drag it into the recipe column. The flag is `picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}`
