Cryptography - 50

> Cryptography can be easy, do you know what ROT13 is? cvpbPGS{abg_gbb_onq_bs_n_ceboyrz}


# Writeup

The challenge provides us with the flag but it appears to be [ROT13](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13) encoded. I used [CyberChef](https://gchq.github.io/CyberChef/) for this challenge as it is useful in many crypto challenges. First, input the provided encoded flag in the input section. Then search for ROT13 and drag it into the recipe column. The flag is `picoCTF{not_too_bad_of_a_problem}`
