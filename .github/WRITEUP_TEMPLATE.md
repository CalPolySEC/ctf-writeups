## TL;DR

The TL;DR should include a brief description of both the challenge and the solution.

# Writeup

This is where your content goes. This should include the solution as well as how you got to that solution. Do not just post code without an explanation of the code. Any magic numbers/strings should have an explanation. Be sure to include and images, screenshots and any other figures if necessary. Writeups can be informal and don't have to be a purely technical document so feel free to include any entertaining or comedic content to keep the reader interested.

Any important content you link to should be backed up in the `assets` folder to protect them from [link rot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Link_rot). Don't forget to cite any resources placed in `assets` or copied elsewhere.
